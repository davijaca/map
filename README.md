<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About


This is a single page html application on the Animated Bus Map from the MIT xPro course.

The purpose of this exercise was to learn the implementation of APIs on web applications. The map, which is provided by the MapBox api, shows the locations of certain bus routes in the Boston area, locations which are provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority API.

On clicking the UPDATE button, the current geolocation of each bus is updated on the map.
